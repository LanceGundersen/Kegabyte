Kegabyte
========

Kegabyte is a simple stand alone Kegerator Monitoring System.

The Kegabyte project is focused on a relative low cost and standalone 
kegerator monitoring system. It was started in large part due to not finding a 
suitable alternative present on the web.

Current Features are:

- Standalone operation utilizing a low cost atMega328p microcontroller (Arduino).
- LCD User Interface.
- Flow Monitoring of two keg lines.
- Temperature Monitoring of the chest and tower.
- Red Green Blue (RGB) LED Light strip control via potentiometers.
